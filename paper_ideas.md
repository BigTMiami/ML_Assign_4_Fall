convergence uses max_iter limit calculation - what is this
max_iter governed by gamma, and epsilon.  max_iters is the necessary amount to get to it

show rate of change

iteration 

state size vs time

discount, max reward, epsilon / error vs max_iter

forest - essentially one best policy
lake - many maps may have several best policies

policy iteration doesn't converge
try modified pi to allow convergence using threshold?
